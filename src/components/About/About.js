        <AboutText>
          Kumusta! I'm Christian Bolofer, a student from Pangasinan State
          University â€” Alaminos City Campus and a Filipino UI/UX and creative
          graphic designer based in the Philippines. I'm passionate about using
          my design to improve the lives of others, and I am always eager to
          learn new things everyday. In my spare time, I enjoy photography,
          video editing, and spending time with my lovable cats. I am passionate
          about designing user experiences that are pleasant, meaningful, and
          powerful.
